# summer-reading-challenge
This is my Code Louisville C#.Net Course Project built with C# on ASP.Net framework, using SQL database.

It is a web app for children to log the books they read during summer, add books to the list, along with the Author's name and the date they finish reading it. It has full CRUD capability, where the user can edit any data provided previously, or delete any entry, with data persisting in the LocalDB database. 

Responsive to different screen resolutions with the use of bootstrap.

To Run the Project requires a working copy of Visual Studio and a local installation of Microsoft SQLLocalDb.
